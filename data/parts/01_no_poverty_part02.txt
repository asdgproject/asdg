job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. Globally, there are 122 women aged 25 to 34 living in extreme poverty for every 100 men of the same age group. The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa. High poverty rates are often found in small, fragile and conflict-affected countries. Poverty affects children disproportionately. One out of five children live in extreme poverty. As of 2018, 55% of the worldâ€™s population have no access to social protection. In 2018, only 41% of women giving birth received maternity cash benefits. By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day. By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership
