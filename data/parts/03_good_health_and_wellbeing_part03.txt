In rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty. Concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health. What progress have we made so far? Major progress has been made in several areas, including in child and maternal health as well as in addressing HIV/AIDS.
