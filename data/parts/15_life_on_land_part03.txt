species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.

Only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production. Over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. Only three cereal crops, rice, maize and wheat, provide 60 per cent of energy intake. As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-Â­based medicines for basic healthcare. Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged. By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve
